# Welcome to the EnzymeML GitHub!

This organization is home to various useful tools, libraries, and data models revolving around the data exchange format [EnzymeML](https://realenzymeml.org).

## What is EnzymeML?

EnzymeML is a free, open XML-based format that adheres to the FAIR principles and serves as a standard for the systematic monitoring and exchange of data pertaining to enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Its primary objective is to facilitate the storage and transfer of enzyme kinetics data across electronic laboratory notebooks, software tools, and databases.

An EnzymeML document encompasses a comprehensive collection of data, including both the results of experimental measurements and the modeling outcomes. This may include time course data derived from a series of experiments with varying initial substrate concentrations, analyzed using the Michaelis-Menten model.

EnzymeML is compatible with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and continues to be developed and extended by an international community, with support from the STRENDA Commission.
